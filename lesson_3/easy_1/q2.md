When naming methods, '!' is used to indicate that a method mutates the caller.
'?' is used when the method returns a boolean value.

'!' is also used as the 'not' operator, and '?' is used in ternary statements.

1. '!=' means 'not equal to' and you would use it when comparing two values
that you expect to be different.
2. '!' before something will return the opposite 'truthiness' of that value.
'!user_name' will return 'false' if 'user_name' equals anything other than 'nil'
or 'false'.
3. '!' after a method that can be destructive will mutate the caller instead of
leaving the orignal value intact and only returning a copy of the mutated value.
4. Putting '?' before something causes Ruby to interpret it as a string literal.
5. Putting '?' after something doesn't do anything unless you're using it at the
end of a method name to indicate that the method returns a boolean value
6. Putting !! before something returns its 'truthiness' boolean value.
