In the second section of outputs, the IDs will be the same as the first
because the variables that we're outputting were assigned to store the
object IDs of the original for variables.

In the third section of outputs, the IDs will be different than they
originally were, because assignment doesn't mutate the original memory location,
it creates a new object in a new location.

In the fourth section of outputs the IDs will be the same, for the same reason
that they were the same in the second section of outputs.

In the fifth section of outputs, the values will be the same as they were
assigned to inside the block of code, but the IDs will be different because
they are storing the IDs before reassignment and the IDs after 
reassignment.

The sixth section of outputs will display the rescue text because the code
is trying to access variables that were initialized in an inner scope that
isn't available in this outer scope.
