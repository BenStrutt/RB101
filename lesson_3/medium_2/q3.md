First output will read as follows:
My string looks like this now: pumpkins

Second output will read as follows:

This is because the '+=' method doesn't mutate the caller, and leaves the string
object outside of the method the same as it was before the method was called.
The '<<' method, however, does mutate the caller and alters the actual array
oject that is stored in memory.
