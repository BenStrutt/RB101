In the second section of outputs, the IDs will be the same, because arguments
passed to methods pass the pointer to memory location of the value being
passed.  

In the third section of outputs, the IDs will be different for the 'before'
and 'after', because reassignment doesn't mutate the original object, but rather
created a new object with a new object ID.

In the fourth section of outputs, the IDs will be the same because the '_outer'
variables were reassigned, and then the '_inner' variables were assigned to
point to the same objects as the '_outer' variables.

In the fifth section of outputs, the IDs will be different than the ones inside
the method, and the same as they were before the method is called. This is
because the method didn't alter the original objects at all.

The sixth section of outputs will output the rescue text because the variables
initialized inside the method aren't accessible outside of it.
