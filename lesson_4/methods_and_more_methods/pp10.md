The return value of the code is [nil, 2, 3]. This is because the 'map' method
assigns the return value of the block to the index of the array that it is
currently on. The first iteration returns 'nil' as a result of calling the
'puts' method, so it assigns 'nil' to index 0. The following two iterations
return the original value so those are assigned to their respective indices and
then the (new) modified array is returned.
