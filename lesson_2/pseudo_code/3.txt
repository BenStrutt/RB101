Given an array of integers.

Set a new empty array variable to store result.
Set a variable to track which iteration through a loop we're in.
Initialize this variable to 0.
Write a loop to itirate over each value in the given array.
Increment the iteration variable by 1.
If the iteration variable is odd, push the variable at the current index to
the results array.

Return the results array.




START

# Given an array of strings stored as 'given_array'

SET result_array = []
SET iteration = 0

WHILE iteration < length of given_array
  IF (iteration + 1) mod 2 != 1
    PUSH given_array[iteration] to result_array
  
  iteration += 1

PRINT result_array
